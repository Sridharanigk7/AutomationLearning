Software testing  - Relase quality products to customer/finding bugs
Manual Testing - tools not used
Automation Testing - performing testing using Tools

Re-testing - Same test excuted multiple times with dif data conditions
	eg,lgin user name with positive & Negative conditions 
	challenge : Time consuming & lot of effort
	
Regression Testing - 
	eg, once built relase by dev, tester should test according to requirement in multiple cycles (SDLC)
	Built 1--10TC  8 passed , 2 failed
	Built 2 + bug fixes --- bug retest, dependant test case to check existing function is not broken called regression
	

To overcome Retesting / Regression testing - Automation came 

Severity and Priority 

Impact of the defect represents Severity
Urgency or how quickly to fix a defect represents priority

eg : system crash in rare condition - severity high and priority low
eg : logo on the home page is incorrect - Severity low and priority is high(user trust issue)
eg:  Minor spelling mistake in Help section - both are low


---------------------------------------------- STLC and SDLC -----------------------------------	

STLC - 	Focus on Testing/Quality of software
		
		Requirement Analysis
		Test Plan
		Test Case
		Environment Setup
		Test Execution 
		Test closure
		
		
SDLC - focus on Development/Deployment(testing)

		Requirement Analysis 
		Plan
		Design 
		Development
		Testing
		Deployment
		Maintance
	
---------------------------------------------- Types of Testing ---------------------------------------------------

Functional Testing  -Focuses on verifying that the software functions as intended and meets the specified requirements
	1. Unit Testing
	2. Integrated testing 
	3. System Testing
	4. User Acceptance testing
	
Manual Testing   -
	1. Exploratory testing 
	2. Adhoc Testing 
	
Automated Testing - 
	1. Regression Testing	-		New changes don’t break existing features
	2. Smoke Testing		-		basic functionality
	3. Sanity Testing		-		specific functionality after minor changes

White-Box Testing		-		Tests internal structures or workings of an application DEV
Black-Box Testing		-		Focuses on testing the application without knowing its internal workings
Grey-Box Testing		-		A hybrid approach combining aspects of both white-box and black-box testing

Specialized Testing
	1. API Testing
	2. Database Testing
	3. Mobile Testing
	4. Game Testing
	5. AI/ML Testing

Agile is a project management and software development philosophy that emphasizes flexibility, iterative progress, and customer collaboration.
	
	Key Principles of Agile (from the Agile Manifesto):
		1. Customer Collaboration: Engage customers throughout the development process for feedback.
		2. Responding to Change: Adapt quickly to changing requirements.
		3. Individuals and Interactions: Prioritize people and teamwork over processes and tools.
		4. Working Software: Deliver functional software frequently (short iterations).
	
	
Scrum is a specific Agile framework that focuses on delivering value incrementally through sprints. It defines roles, events, and artifacts to structure and organize work.
	
	Roles:	Product Owner 
			Scrum Master
			Development Team
			
	Artifacts : Product Backlog
				Sprint Backlog
				Increment
				
	Events:   Sprint planning
			  Daily scrum
			  Sprint review
			  Sprint retrospective
			  
	Sprints: 2-4 weeks - time boxed iterations
	
----------------------------------------------------- Bug Cycle -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New → Assigned → Open → Fixed → Retest → Verified → Closed
      ↑                               ↓
    Rejected                         Reopened
      ↓                               ↑
   Deferred                        Duplicate\
